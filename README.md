Prevents update conflicts using the optimistic lock pattern in Laravel

This package can work independently of the [Liberu](https://github.com/laravel-enso/Liberu) ecosystem.

For live examples and demos, you may visit [laravel-enso.com](https://www.laravel-enso.com)

## Installation

1. install the package `composer require laravel-enso/versioning` 
2. run the migrations
3. use the `Versionable` trait on the models you want versioning on.

By default, the version value is kept in a 'version' attribute, but this can be customized (see below).

## Features

- the package creates a `versionings` table where it holds versions for all the versionable models
- by using the `Versionable` trait on a model, versioning is handled automatically
- by default the trait appends a `version` attribute after the model is retrieved, used for tracking versions and expects the same attribute to be present on the model when the update is called
- the default versioning attribute can be customized by using `protected $versioningAttribute = 'customVersionAttribte'` on the model
- the trait can be used on models that already have records in the database, the versioning starts with the first retrieval of those models
- when a versionable model is deleted, its versioning is deleted also. If the model uses `SoftDeletes`, the versioning is not deleted, unless doing a `forceDelete`
- throws a `ConflictHttpException` if the version does not match on update
- tests are included with the package
